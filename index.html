  <!-- Postcards to Pals:

    I used to pick up postcards or small flyers to put on my wall, and this is what it looked like in 2018
    although it was partially taken down when I took the picture. When I decided not to recreate the wall
    when I moved, I wanted to do something with the cards.

    I decided I would mail them to people, and describe where the card came from as the post card.
    I didn't share the project with people who might receive cards, and only told them about
    the larger project afterwards. In January of 2020, I sent my final card from the collection,
    and I wanted to find a way to share the wall with others.

    I thought to take an image of the original wall after I had taken some items down, so I've retroactively
    added back some of the cards, and sometimes covered up photographs on the wall of those
    I know want to preserve their privacy.

        data-alt="Postcard showing the painting The Young Martyr. A woman, illuminated, lies prone in water with a halo over her face, on a dark background where more details are difficult to see. It has a hole in the top, caused by a push-pin."
        data-caption="My favorite, and the last card. I couldn't find a way to photograph this postcard (itself a representation of another piece of art) that I was satisfied with. This is one of the first paintings to shock me, and it made me feel something. I saw it in the Louvre and I honestly can't remember if it was in high school, or during study abroad... But I've had this a long time, and you can see the dark tape residue on it, and pin holes from where it was stuck to a cork board in the past. I've loved this. This card went to Pam S (me)."></a>
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5nvSAXnwk5/" title="glaciar" style="position: absolute; left: 21.64%; top: 74.61%; width: 8.13%; height: 14.87%; z-index: 2;"

        data-caption="From anti-winter 2016! Where I somehow was convinced to spend the vacation part of my trip on a *glacier* 🏔️ we stayed in the nearby village of Calafate. There is liquor and tea etc made from Calafate berries, and my Argentinian friend said if you eat them you'll come back to Argentinian. I was in Argentina again earlier this year to see the solar eclipse. This card went to Kelly C (he/him)."></a>

        data-alt="Postcard of a photograph of an old mill along a river in the fall"
        data-caption="A thrift store card. I think it reminded me of Kentucky, or maybe I wanted pastoral scenes. I wrote about Spring Mill, a state park in Indiana I went to multiple times as a kid. This card went to Genevieve C."></a>

        data-alt="Postcard/print showing a cartoon turnip wearing headphones and the text Turnip the Beat"
        data-caption="This was a print from an art fair (although can you call them prints when you can mail them as postcards? Are there rules?). It's a vegetable pun! And this one wasn't on the original wall, but it was in the stack to be mailed as it adorned a kitchen cabinet (bc vegetables!). This card went to Kristina D."></a>

        data-caption="From a restaurant in New York from when I spent 3 months living there in 2015 for a programming retreat. When I learned winter in New York consists of those puddles that actually are entrances to another dimension, given their unknown depths. This card went to James W."></a>

        data-caption="Obliteration of Eternity by Yayoi Kusama, I got this at the big Kusama exhibition in DC a few years ago, when I went with my friend Zach. We stood in line for exhibition tickets (free) and went to these amazing spaces Kusama created. This one was one of my favorites. This card went to Andrea."></a>
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BrVjRsanwiK/" title="carp"
        data-alt="Postcard showing an art piece that is a black and white, or perhaps sepia, representation of a carp"
        data-caption="Another thrift store card. Carp! Or maybe I did get it at the Met. Or another art museum. Who knows! I used to go fishing with my father growing up, maybe that's why I liked it. I wrote about how I went to the Met (opera) a few years ago. This card went to Samantha F."

        data-alt="Blue postcard with an illustration of a coffee plant (I assume), with the text Elixir Coffee Roasters"
        data-caption="A rare Philadelphia postcard. This is from the Elixir coffee shop, when they had some sort of writing postcards activity. I went with my friend Corey and apparently the postcards were also free for all, as far as I can tell. It's one of the best coffee shops in Philadelphia but I go there rarely because I tend to go to Menagerie instead these days. This card went to Melanie T. Also, did the thing where I forgot to take the picture before I wrote the address."></a>

        data-caption="So one time, I volunteered at a cat circus show (it was all really ethical, and sometimes the cats would just not do things because, well, they're cats). It was a wonderfully bizarre experience. This card went to Jhoon S."></a>

        data-caption="From the 2016 road trip around France, in an ugly bright yellow car because that's the only automatic car the rental place had, and they clearly were mocking my ex husband and I in only the way French people can mock you, honestly a bit endearing. This Abbaye was one I visited in high school but was grateful for the new visit and really enjoyed it (plus, it was likely much more restored 10+ years later). This card went to Chris A (luckily I didn't finish writing out the name, so no address-covering needed)"></a>

I actually used it as a guide to the shore of Lima while I was there, to try and see the beaches of Miraflores y Barranco.

        <p>For years, I've collected postcards and put them on my wall, to mark places I've been,
          places that inpired me, or things I just plain like. In 2018 as part of a major life
          reset, I moved, and I took down all the postcards. I didn't want to put them back up again,
          so then the question was, what to do with them?</p>

        <p>I decided I would mail them to people, and describe where the card came from as the post card.
