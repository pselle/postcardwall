  <!-- Postcards to Pals:

    For years, I've collected postcards and put them on my wall, to mark places I've been,
    places that inpired me, or things I just plain like. In 2018 as part of a major life
    reset, I moved, and I took down all the postcards. I didn't want to put them back up again,
    so then the question was, what to do with them?

    I decided I would mail them to people, and describe where the card came from as the post card.
    I didn't share the project with people who might receive cards, and only told them about
    the larger project afterwards. In January of 2020, I sent my final card from the collection,
    and I wanted to find a way to share the wall with others.

    I thought to take an image of the original wall after I had taken some items down, so I've retroactively
    added back some of the cards, and sometimes covered up photographs on the wall of those
    I know want to preserve their privacy.

        <p>There are lots of things on this wall. Some of them are postcards that ended up becoming
          part of the Postcards to Pals project. Poke around and see what you find.</p>
        <p>An active card links to the corresponding post on Instagram, where you can see the back of the card as well
          which describes the card. The caption (often) includes who the card went to.</p>
